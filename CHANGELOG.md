# Changelog

All notable changes to FlightDeck will be documented in this file.

Future releases should group notes under `New features`, `Improvements`, and `Bug fixes` so the repo changelog and GitHub Releases stay aligned.

## [Unreleased]

### New features

- Add **Pull base**: run `git pull --rebase` on the base folder to bring the
  local base branch current after a PR is merged, without leaving FlightDeck.
  Available from the command palette (*Pull Base*) and `Ctrl-u`; refuses on a
  dirty base folder and aborts on conflict, leaving the base folder untouched.
- First-class Linux support: ship an `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` release binary,
  run clippy and tests on `ubuntu-latest` in CI, and post desktop notifications
  via `notify-send` (libnotify).

### Improvements

- Automate release-time changelog rollover so `./scripts/release <version>`
  moves `Unreleased` notes into the new version entry and resets the template.
- Clicking anywhere in the agent sidebar — the heading or empty space, not just
  an agent row — now switches to APP mode, so it works with zero or one agents.

### Bug fixes

- Restore mouse text selection in Split View and make wheel scrolling target
  the column under the pointer.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-29

Initial release.

### Supported features

#### Parallel agent workflows

- Run multiple local AI coding agents in parallel against the same Git repository.
- Create an isolated Git worktree and branch for each agent tab.
- Choose the agent per tab from configured agents, with OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex CLI supported out of the box.
- Open additional shell tabs inside the same worktree.
- Recover saved tabs and managed worktrees when FlightDeck restarts.

#### Git-safe workflow

- Auto-initialize `.flightdeck/` inside a Git repository on first run.
- Append FlightDeck runtime entries to `.gitignore` without overwriting existing content.
- Show per-tab Git status including branch, file-change counts, ahead/behind, base drift, and upstream state.
- Push branches with confirmation and show a GitHub compare URL for pull request creation.
- Support a guarded local merge-back flow when strict preconditions are met.
- Abandon managed worktrees safely, with confirmation before discarding uncommitted changes.
- Enforce a no-history-rewrite boundary: FlightDeck does not stage files, create commits, amend commits, rebase, squash, force-push, or create pull requests.

#### Terminal UI and controls

- Provide a keyboard-first terminal UI with app mode, terminal mode, a command palette, and inline help.
- Support fast tab and terminal navigation with keyboard shortcuts.
- Support mouse selection for agent tabs and child terminals.
- Show a per-tab sidebar with agent process and status indicators.

#### Agent status and notifications

- Track live agent activity with default `working` and `idle` states.
- Allow manual status overrides.
- Offer optional precise agent status integrations via `flightdeck setup-status`.
- Offer optional macOS notifications when an agent finishes, waits for input, or fails.

#### Container support

- Run agents inside isolated rootless Podman containers.
- Bind-mount the host worktree into the container at `/workspace`.
- Reuse the same container for child shells.
- Reattach to still-running containers after restarting FlightDeck.
- Build agent images with `flightdeck image build` and validate readiness with `flightdeck doctor`.
- Support resource limits, localhost-only port forwarding, and controlled credential mounts or environment allowlists.
- Enforce container guardrails such as no `--privileged`, no container socket mounts, no home-directory mounts, `--cap-drop all`, and `no-new-privileges`.

#### Installation, updates, and platform support

- Install via Homebrew, the shell installer, or the Windows PowerShell installer.
- Self-update installer-based macOS and Linux installs with `flightdeck update`.
- Offer an opt-in once-daily update notice with `flightdeck setup-update`.
- Ship macOS and Windows builds from GitHub Releases.
